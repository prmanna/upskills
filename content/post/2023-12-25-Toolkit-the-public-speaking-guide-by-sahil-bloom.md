##### Summary

Confession: I am a nervous public speaker. But confident public speaking is a critical skill, so we need a set of strategies to increase our confidence and perform as the best version of ourselves.
* Prep Strategies: 
1. Study the best speakers and learn from them, 
2. Create a clear storytelling structure, and 
3. Build "lego blocks" but avoid rote memorization.
* Pre-Stage Strategies: 
1. Address the Spotlight Effect and ask "so what?" about your worst fears, 
2. Get into character and turn on the best version of yourself, and 
3. Eliminate stress with a simple breathing technique.
* Delivery Strategies: 
1. Cut the tension in the crowd at the outset, 
2. Use big, broad gestures and avoid touching your pockets or torso, and 
3. Move with purposeful, slow steps.

## 26 Money Rules For 2026

Here are the **26 Money Rules for 2026** as shared by Sahil Bloom — practical financial principles and mindsets to guide how you think about and use money in your life. 

1. **No unforced errors.** Avoid avoidable mistakes like impulse buys, unnecessary debt, and emotional investing.
2. **Never allow self-worth to be dictated by net worth.** Your value isn’t tied to money.
3. **Track financial progress like an athlete tracks performance.** You can’t improve what you don’t measure.
4. **Increase your Margin of Freedom.** Keep lifestyle below means and create slack in your finances.
5. **Focus on value, impact, and service over money.** Money follows value creation.
6. **Treat income as the leverage point, not investments.** Growing earning power often beats optimizing returns.
7. **Spend more for quality, not for brand.** Quality often costs less in the long run.
8. **Always fade trends and external expectations.** Don’t buy into cultural financial timelines.
9. **Debt is a tool, not the enemy, but use it sparingly.** Avoid debt for depreciating purchases.
10. **Follow a 24-hour rule for non-essential purchases above a threshold.** Delay impulse buying.
11. **Remember that investments require time, not just money.** Consider both money and time inputs.
12. **Remember that returns come in many forms beyond money.** Access, learning, and network can matter just as much.
13. **Never think twice about investments in yourself.** Fitness, learning, and health pay huge dividends.
14. **Never use money to optimize the life out of your life.** Don’t remove meaningful friction that gives life texture.
15. **Create a monthly financial check-in with your partner.** Alignment prevents money-related conflict.
16. **Focus on expanding your savings rate.** The gap between income and expenses is the real asset.
17. **Work towards a 12-month emergency fund.** Peace of mind and optionality in hard times are worth it.
18. **Run quarterly disaster simulations.** Plan for worst-case financial scenarios.
19. **Don’t waste energy on small games (unless it brings joy).** Focus on major financial decisions, not trivia.
20. **Use the Bought Status Test.** Ask if you’d buy something if no one knew—cuts through social signaling.
21. **Consider a barbell approach to investments.** Balance safe, steady holdings with small high-risk bets.
22. **Ruthlessly eliminate complexity.** Simplicity prevents mistakes and improves control.
23. **Automate payment of small recurring expenses.** Free up mental energy for strategic money decisions.
24. **Conduct quarterly audits of recurring expenses.** Find and cut hidden costs like unused subscriptions.
25. **Tip generously whenever you’re able.** Generosity compounds happiness and goodwill.
26. **Use money as a tool for more meaningful forms of wealth.** Use money to buy time, health, experiences, and purpose, not just stuff.

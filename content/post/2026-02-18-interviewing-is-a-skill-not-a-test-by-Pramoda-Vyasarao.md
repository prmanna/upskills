#### How to Show Your True Level in a Job Interview by Pramoda Vyasarao

Here are 5 practical tips to get ready for interviews at Big Tech companies:

❶ **Think in impact stories, not task lists**
- When describing your work, start with the problem, then describe your contribution, and finally, the measurable outcome.
- Use specific metrics or tangible results to anchor your impact.
- Replace “I built X” with “I built X to solve Y, which resulted in Z.”

❷ **Reflect on scope and influence**
- Ask yourself: Did I execute or did I lead?
- Clarify whether you influenced just your module or cross-functional systems.
- Interviewers listen for _scope_ more than _effort._

❸ **Practice structured communication**
- Use short, logical narratives instead of rambling through details.
- Pause between sections and check for alignment with the interviewer.
- Treat your answers like short stories with a clear beginning, middle, and end.

❹ **Demonstrate leadership behaviors, even in technical questions**
- Highlight how you mentored others, made trade-offs, or handled ambiguity.
- Big Tech companies value collaboration and influence as much as coding ability.
- When I coach candidates, I often see them undersell their work because they skip the outcome. A sentence like _“I reduced deployment time by 30%”_ instantly changes how interviewers perceive your level.
    
❺ **Simulate real interviews out loud**
- Thinking in your head is not the same as speaking under pressure.
- Record your mock answers and listen for clarity, tone, and logical flow.
- You’ll quickly notice whether your stories sound impactful or flat.
    
Mastering communication doesn’t mean rehearsing perfect lines. It means building self-awareness to express your work with clarity and purpose. It’s what allows your true level to show up naturally in a conversation, just like Jeff said.

Looking back, Jeff’s insight wasn’t just about interviews. It was about life. The way you communicate your work determines how far your work takes you.
Learn the art of communication and storytelling. It’s the most human skill you can build — and it’ll help you thrive in the age of AI.

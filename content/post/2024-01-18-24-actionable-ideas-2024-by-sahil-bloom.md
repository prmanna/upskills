### 24 Ways to Change Your Life in 2024 by [Sahil Bloom](https://twitter.com/SahilBloom)

#### Life Actions
* ##### To identify what to prioritize in your days, use my [Energy Calendar Technique](https://www.sahilbloom.com/newsletter/energy-calendars-how-to-negotiate-more). 
* ##### To improve your focus, turn on [Grayscale Mode](https://www.sahilbloom.com/newsletter/life-changing-phone-hack-hard-things-more).
* ##### To improve the quality of your outcomes, spend more time around the big thinkers in your circle.
* ##### To unlock new asymmetric upside in your life, schedule a [Think Day](https://www.sahilbloom.com/newsletter/the-think-day-your-secret-weapon).
* ##### To make dramatic progress in 30 days, try my 30-for-30 approach.

#### Work Actions
* ##### To improve your focus and get more done, get a focus app and set your phone on Do Not Disturb mode.
* ##### To reduce the impact of [attention residue](https://www.sahilbloom.com/newsletter/attention-residue-the-silent-productivity-killer), take short breaks between meetings.
* ##### To improve your [balance of professional time](https://www.sahilbloom.com/newsletter/the-4-types-of-professional-time), assess your current mix and make small changes to it.
* ##### To prioritize more effectively, use an [Eisenhower Matrix](https://www.sahilbloom.com/newsletter/the-ultimate-productivity-tool).
* ##### To improve your work efficiency, batch email and message processing into 1-3 condensed windows.

#### Health Actions
* ##### To improve your mental and physical health, go for more walks.
* ##### To improve your health and grit, get cold more often.
* ##### To fall asleep faster, try the 4-7-8 method.
* ##### To eat healthier, do all your shopping on the outer perimeter of the store.
* ##### To start your day with energy, try my 5-5-5-30 method.
    When you wake up, do 5 push-ups, 5 squats, 5 lunges, and a 30-second plank. You can do it while you are brewing coffee or right when you get out of bed. It will jumpstart your metabolism and give you a boost of energy to start the day.

#### Money Actions
* ##### To set your wealth on autopilot, create an automated direct deposit into an investment account every month.
* ##### To improve the quality of your spending, never think twice about investments in yourself, but wait 48 hours on material purchases.
    Investments in yourself include books, sleep, fitness, network, quality food, mental health, and personal development. Never think twice on these.
* ##### To clear your mind, automate all basic financial tasks such as paying bills, credit cards, and investing.

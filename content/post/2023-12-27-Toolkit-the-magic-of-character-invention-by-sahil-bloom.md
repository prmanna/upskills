### Toolkit - The Magic of Character Invention by [Sahil Bloom](https://twitter.com/SahilBloom)

##### Summary by Sahil
* We all struggle with some degree of self-doubt and fear of failure. It's particularly common among ambitious high-achievers, who, by definition, are constantly putting themselves in situations that are on the edge of their current competency level.
* Character Invention: Create a character in your mind who can show up in the way you want to and teach yourself to "flip the switch" to become this character when necessary.
* Character Invention in three steps: 
  1. Identify the situations where you'd like to show up as the best version of yourself, 
  2. Envision the character you would like to embody in each situation, and 
  3. Get yourself some reps by turning on this character in those situations.

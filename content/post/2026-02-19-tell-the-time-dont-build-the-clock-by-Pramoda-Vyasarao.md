#### How to Overcome the Curse of Knowledge and Connect with Executives

There’s a habit many experts fall into. I know it well because I lived it.

It’s called the curse of knowledge—the tendency to over-explain once we know something deeply. We forget what it’s like not to know. So we share the whole story, thinking it adds value. But in doing so, we often lose the people we’re trying to reach, especially executive leaders.


Here are five ways to start:

❶ Start with the takeaway. Begin where most people end.
❷ Use simple language. Swap technical terms for plain ones.
❸ Lead with the impact. Talk outcomes, not inputs.
❹ Invite questions. Let the audience draw out details as needed.
❺ Study effective communication. Read Made to Stick by the Heath brothers—it’s a masterclass in clarity.

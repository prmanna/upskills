## The Real AI Risk Nobody Told You About
4 principles (and clear rules) to protect myself from AI Brain:


### Principle 1: Embrace First-Pass Thinking
* I think before I prompt.
* I write before I refine. 
* I decide before I optimize. 

### Principle 2: Preserve Cognitive Friction
* I allow boredom to exist.
* I seek out solitude.
* I sit with problems longer than feels efficient.
* I slow down my thinking

### Principle 3: Do Less, But Deeper
* I identify the 2-3 most important things. 
* I say no to most ideas.
* I measure quality, not quantity. 

### Principle 4: Do More Human Things
* I prioritize in-person interaction. 
* I do physically hard things.

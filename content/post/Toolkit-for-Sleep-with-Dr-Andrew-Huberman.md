1) View sunlight by going outside within 30-60 minutes of waking. Do that again in the late afternoon, prior to sunset. 
2) Wake up at the same time each day and go to sleep when you first start to feel sleepy.
3) Avoid caffeine within 8-10 hours of bedtime. 
4) If you have sleep disturbances, insomnia, or anxiety about sleep, try the research-supported protocols on the Reveri app
5) Avoid viewing bright lights—especially bright overhead lights between 10 pm and 4 am. 
6) Limit daytime naps to less than 90 min, or don’t nap at all. 
7) If you wake up in the middle of the night (which, by the way, is normal to do once or so each night) but you can’t fall back asleep, consider doing an NSDR protocol when you wake up
8) You might consider taking (30-60 min before bed) (AVOID)
9) Expect to feel really alert ~1 hour before your natural bedtime. This is a naturally occurring spike in wakefulness that sleep researchers have observed.  Don’t freak out if it happens. It will pass!
10) Keep the room you sleep in cool and dark and layer on blankets that you can remove.
11) Drinking alcohol messes up your sleep.

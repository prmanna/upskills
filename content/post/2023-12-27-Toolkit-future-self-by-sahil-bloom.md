### Toolkit - Mental Time Travel: A Cheat Code for Success by [Sahil Bloom](https://twitter.com/SahilBloom)

##### Summary by Sahil

* I have spent time with a lot of very successful people. I have observed two common trends: 
  1. A struggle to appreciate the present and 
  2. A struggle to identify the key actions to create the desired future.
* The tool we can all use to fight back: Mental Time Travel. This involves the vivid imagination of both the past and the future. You use your mind to figuratively "travel" to the experienced past and the envisioned future.
* Professionally, Mental Time Travel allows us to consider both 
  1. the gap between where we are and where we want to be and 
  2. the gain between where we were and where we are. 

Personally, Mental Time Travel allows us to build a robust gratitude practice and appreciate the present state.

## The Hercules Principle

**No one is coming to save you.**
**No one will fix your problems.**
**No one will change your mindsets.**
**No one will hand you the things you want in life.** 

**It's just you. It's all on you.**

Contrary to what your first reaction to this may be, it’s not morbid or depressing. It’s empowering. Even inspiring.

The Hercules Principle is a reminder that you are in control. Don’t look out. Look in. You have within you everything you need...

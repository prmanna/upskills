Here are the **22 pieces of career advice from Sahil Bloom’s “22 Pieces of Career Advice They Don’t Teach You in School”** — the distilled lessons he wished he’d known early in his career: 

1. **Be valuable.** Create value first; money follows value. 
    
2. **Durable things take a long time to build.** No shortcuts. 
    
3. **Be the person who can figure it out.** Solve problems even when you don’t initially know how. 
    
4. **There are no style points in life.** Simple execution matters more than flashy moves. 
    
5. **People want to do business with people they like.** Be likable and pleasant to work with. 
    
6. **The best opportunities look like tiny cracks, not open doors.** Big wins often come from small openings. 
    
7. **Inputs are great, but you’re paid for your outputs.** Focus on results. 
    
8. **Extraordinary outputs require extraordinary inputs.** Be willing to put in hard work. 
    
9. **The ability to take feedback is a long-term competitive advantage.** Seek and embrace critique. 
    
10. **Seek out rooms where you don’t feel like you belong.** Growth happens outside your comfort zone. 
    
11. **Always focus on doing.** Execution beats talk every time. 
    
12. **Potential is nothing without execution.** Deliver on what you promise. 
    
13. **Everything matters.** Consistency counts in small and big things alike. 
    
14. **Learn to sell.** Communication and persuasion are core career skills. 
    
15. **Build a reputation for reliability.** Consistent follow-through is rare and valuable. 
    
16. **If you want to accomplish anything significant, you have to work hard.** Hard work sets the foundation. 
    
17. **Don’t follow your passion; follow your energy.** Energy fuels deep engagement and learning. 
    
18. **Be selective in the games you choose to play.** Win where your strengths give you advantage. 
    
19. **Closed mouths don’t get fed.** Ask for what you want when you’ve earned it. 
    
20. **Do the “old fashioned” things well.** Basic professionalism and manners still matter. 
    
21. **Side hustles are usually just distractions.** Many “extra” income streams steal focus from what matters most. 
    
22. **Your employer (probably) doesn’t care about you.** Companies prioritize business outcomes over personal loyalty — act accordingly. 
    
Sahil’s advice focuses less on technical skills and more on **mindset, execution, value creation, relationships, and real-world work habits.** These are things you _don’t learn in school_ but that determine long-term career progress.

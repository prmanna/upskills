## Monday: The Antelope Principle: How to Chase the Right Things

A lion can easily catch a field mouse—but the energy it burns in the process exceeds the calories it gains. A lion that spends its days chasing mice will eventually starve. To thrive, it must hunt antelope.

Every single day, you face the same choice:

- Chase field mice: the small, urgent problems and opportunities that pull at your attention; or
- Hunt antelope: the big, important pursuits that require focus and effort but actually move the needle.

Busyness can trick you into feeling productive, but motion isn’t momentum. A rocking horse moves all day and never goes anywhere.

The lion that chases mice will starve. The lion that hunts antelope will thrive.

_What are you hunting today?_

### The Personal Annual Review by [Sahil Bloom](https://twitter.com/SahilBloom)

##### Summary

The end of the calendar year presents us with a valuable opportunity to reflect on the year that was and plan for the year that will be. It's easy to glaze over the former and focus on the latter, but failure to reflect will eventually manifest as a failure to grow.
The Personal Annual Review is 7 questions: 
1. What did I change my mind on this year? 
2. What created energy this year? 
3. What drained energy this year? 
4. Who were the boat anchors in my life? 
5. What did I not do because of fear? 
6. What were my greatest hits and worst misses? 
7. What did I learn this year?

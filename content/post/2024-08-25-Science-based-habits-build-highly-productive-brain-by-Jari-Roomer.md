### 4 Science-based habits to build a highly productive brain| Jari Roomer
Most people reading this are - or will be - knowledge workers.

In other words, they make money with their mind.

And if you make money with your mind, you're a **mental athlete.**

Just like Olympic athletes train their muscles, mental athletes should train their brains, as it can help with:

- Faster information processing
- Enhanced focus & mental clarity
- Increased mental efficiency
- Better decision-making
- Less brain fog & mental fatigue

In other words, a healthy, high-performing brain gives you a competitive advantage in today's fast-paced knowledge economy.

And that's why, in this email, we'll go over four science-based habits to build a faster, more productive brain.

## **Habit #1: Manage Stress**
Chronic stress wreaks havoc on the brain and is linked to decreased gray matter in the prefrontal cortex - the area of the brain responsible for future planning, attention, and self-control.

Furthermore, prolonged exposure to stress can lead to chronic inflammation, which has been associated with cognitive decline.

So, to ensure a healthy and high-performing brain - and overall healthy life - it’s important to practice stress-reducing habits such as:

- Meditation
- Exercise
- Journaling
- Gratitude
- Breathwork
- Take time off
- Spend time in nature

## **Habit #2: Prioritize Your Sleep**

Sleep is “recovery mode” for the brain and is vital for better learning, memory, and cognitive function.

During sleep, our brains actively work on repairing neural connections and flushing out toxins from our system.

This critical process helps to protect our brains from potential harm and ensures that we can function at our best when we're awake.

To improve the quality of your sleep, follow these tips:

- Keep your bedroom cool, dark, and quiet to create an optimal sleeping environment
- Put your devices away 1-2 hours before going to bed, as the blue light emitted from our screens disrupt the circadian rhythm and block melatonin production (an essential sleep hormone)
- Don’t consume caffeine after 3 pm and avoid excessive sugar consumption in the evening

All in all, getting good sleep (7-8 hours per night) is one of the best things you can do for better brain health and cognitive performance.

## **Habit #3: Eat Brain-Boosting Foods**

Foods rich in **high-quality fats** are one of the best brain boosters.

As biohacker and brain expert Dave Asprey writes:

“Fat is an essential nutrient for your brain. Eating the right kinds of fat can help you have more energy and think more clearly.”

The best sources of high-quality fats are:

- Avocados
- Coconut oil
- Fish (wild-caught)
- Nuts
- Eggs
- Grass-fed butter

Another key nutrient to improve our brain health and optimize cognitive performance is **antioxidants**.

Antioxidants help reduce inflammation in the body and brain, which prevents cognitive decline.

Foods rich in antioxidants are:

- Berries
- Spinach
- Brocolli
- Leafy greens
- Walnuts
- Turmeric
- Dark chocolate

All in all, make sure to eat a high-quality diet rich in brain-boosting nutrients such as healthy fats and antioxidants.

## **Habit #4: Exercise Often**

Studies show regular exercise (at least 3x a week) enhances cognitive performance and improves overall brain health.

That's because physical exercise boosts blood flow to the brain and increases the production of **Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF)**.

BDNF is an essential protein that promotes the health & growth of neurons in the brain, which is crucial for overall brain health.

So, if you want to boost your mental performance, make sure to exercise more often. Your brain will thank you for it.

To your productivity,

#### The 3-Step Framework That Helped Me Ace Behavioral Interviews
How structured storytelling turned interviews at Meta and Google into real conversations



After a few **mock interviews**, I realized something important: behavioral interviews aren’t soft conversations—they’re the deciding factor. Those practice rounds exposed how much depth and structure matter when telling your story. So in 2021, as I began interviewing at **Meta, Google, LinkedIn, and Netflix** for engineering leadership roles, I completely reworked my approach from the ground up.

Here’s how I prepared:

❶ **I started with Amazon’s 16 Leadership Principles.  
**They serve as a solid foundation for leadership expectations across most tech companies. Principles like _Dive Deep_, _Hire and Develop the Best_, and _Deliver Results_ closely align with the behaviors that top firms value.

❷ **I picked one recent story from my career for each principle.  
**The story had to fit both the principle and the role level I was targeting. For “Bias for Action,” I recalled a moment when my team had to ship a data pipeline under intense deadlines, and I made a tradeoff between speed and quality.

❸ **I used the STAR framework to structure each story.**

- _Situation:_ What was happening?
- _Task:_ What was my responsibility?
- _Action:_ What did I do?
- _Result:_ What happened, and what did I learn?

I added a reflection at the end of each story to show personal growth. That’s often the missing piece—the learning shows your capacity to evolve.

To make recall easier, I created a **simple table** like this:

[ ![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!CO_y!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F33fc3871-8f6f-4cb3-92b7-d916dfcb7df5_1912x408.png) ](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!CO_y!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F33fc3871-8f6f-4cb3-92b7-d916dfcb7df5_1912x408.png)

I didn’t memorize every word. I remembered moments—key phrases, numbers, and emotions. That helped me sound natural instead of rehearsed.

On interview day, I was calm. Each question became a cue to tell a story I already knew well. Because I’d done the inner work, I wasn’t scrambling for examples. I was connecting my experiences to their values.

That confidence showed. I cleared interviews at **Google and Meta**, and eventually joined **Meta as a Senior Data Engineering Manager**.

Looking back, it wasn’t the structure or the table that helped most—it was the act of reflection itself. Preparing for these interviews forced me to see patterns in my career and how I’d grown as a leader.

Behavioral interviews aren’t about performance. They’re about presence. When you know your own stories deeply, you stop trying to impress and start communicating with clarity and authenticity.

Each behavioral story is like a chapter in your career book. When you know those chapters by heart, you don’t need a script—you tell your story.

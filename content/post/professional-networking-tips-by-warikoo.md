### Networking tips
* Reach out; unless you ask, you'll not get it. Ask for advice, mentoring, coaching.
* Engage with eagerness, wholeheartedly. Everyone has equal importance of time, so, use it wisely. Taken should make the process(for anything) easy for given, otherwise, giver will take back stage.
* If needed, use your shared network.

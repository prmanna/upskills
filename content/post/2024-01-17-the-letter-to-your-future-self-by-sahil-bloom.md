### The Letter to Your Future Self by [Sahil Bloom](https://twitter.com/SahilBloom)

##### Summary by Sahil

* On January 1, 2014, I wrote a letter to my future self just before graduating. Ten years later, I opened it, and it hit me hard. Everyone should do this.
* My core reflection: We have the answers, we just haven't asked the right questions yet.
* To write your own letter to your future self, cover four key areas: 
  1. Reflections on the present, 
  2. Vision for the future, 
  3. Changes to make, and 
  4. Fun predictions. 
#
Use a technology tool (like [FutureMe](https://www.futureme.org/)) or store a physical letter somewhere safe. Set a calendar reminder to open it on the set date in the future.

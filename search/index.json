[{"content":"How to Overcome the Curse of Knowledge and Connect with Executives There’s a habit many experts fall into. I know it well because I lived it.\nIt’s called the curse of knowledge—the tendency to over-explain once we know something deeply. We forget what it’s like not to know. So we share the whole story, thinking it adds value. But in doing so, we often lose the people we’re trying to reach, especially executive leaders.\nHere are five ways to start:\n❶ Start with the takeaway. Begin where most people end. ❷ Use simple language. Swap technical terms for plain ones. ❸ Lead with the impact. Talk outcomes, not inputs. ❹ Invite questions. Let the audience draw out details as needed. ❺ Study effective communication. Read Made to Stick by the Heath brothers—it’s a masterclass in clarity.\nhttps://newsletter.changesmith.me/p/tell-the-time-dont-build-the-clock\n","date":"2026-02-19T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://prasenjitmanna.com/upskills/p/how-to-overcome-the-curse-of-knowledge-and-connect-with-executives-pramoda-vyasarao/","title":"How to Overcome the Curse of Knowledge and Connect with Executives | Pramoda Vyasarao"},{"content":"The 3-Step Framework That Helped Me Ace Behavioral Interviews How structured storytelling turned interviews at Meta and Google into real conversations\nAfter a few mock interviews, I realized something important: behavioral interviews aren’t soft conversations—they’re the deciding factor. Those practice rounds exposed how much depth and structure matter when telling your story. So in 2021, as I began interviewing at Meta, Google, LinkedIn, and Netflix for engineering leadership roles, I completely reworked my approach from the ground up.\nHere’s how I prepared:\n❶ **I started with Amazon’s 16 Leadership Principles.\n**They serve as a solid foundation for leadership expectations across most tech companies. Principles like Dive Deep, Hire and Develop the Best, and Deliver Results closely align with the behaviors that top firms value.\n❷ **I picked one recent story from my career for each principle.\n**The story had to fit both the principle and the role level I was targeting. For “Bias for Action,” I recalled a moment when my team had to ship a data pipeline under intense deadlines, and I made a tradeoff between speed and quality.\n❸ I used the STAR framework to structure each story.\nSituation: What was happening? Task: What was my responsibility? Action: What did I do? Result: What happened, and what did I learn? I added a reflection at the end of each story to show personal growth. That’s often the missing piece—the learning shows your capacity to evolve.\nTo make recall easier, I created a simple table like this:\nI didn’t memorize every word. I remembered moments—key phrases, numbers, and emotions. That helped me sound natural instead of rehearsed.\nOn interview day, I was calm. Each question became a cue to tell a story I already knew well. Because I’d done the inner work, I wasn’t scrambling for examples. I was connecting my experiences to their values.\nThat confidence showed. I cleared interviews at Google and Meta, and eventually joined Meta as a Senior Data Engineering Manager.\nLooking back, it wasn’t the structure or the table that helped most—it was the act of reflection itself. Preparing for these interviews forced me to see patterns in my career and how I’d grown as a leader.\nBehavioral interviews aren’t about performance. They’re about presence. When you know your own stories deeply, you stop trying to impress and start communicating with clarity and authenticity.\nEach behavioral story is like a chapter in your career book. When you know those chapters by heart, you don’t need a script—you tell your story.\nUpdated Table for Amazon’s 16 Leadership Principles.

Use specific metrics or tangible results to anchor your impact. Replace “I built X” with “I built X to solve Y, which resulted in Z.” ❷ Reflect on scope and influence\nAsk yourself: Did I execute or did I lead? Clarify whether you influenced just your module or cross-functional systems. Interviewers listen for scope more than effort. ❸ Practice structured communication\nUse short, logical narratives instead of rambling through details. Pause between sections and check for alignment with the interviewer. Treat your answers like short stories with a clear beginning, middle, and end. ❹ Demonstrate leadership behaviors, even in technical questions\nHighlight how you mentored others, made trade-offs, or handled ambiguity. Big Tech companies value collaboration and influence as much as coding ability. When I coach candidates, I often see them undersell their work because they skip the outcome. A sentence like “I reduced deployment time by 30%” instantly changes how interviewers perceive your level. ❺ Simulate real interviews out loud\nThinking in your head is not the same as speaking under pressure. Record your mock answers and listen for clarity, tone, and logical flow. You’ll quickly notice whether your stories sound impactful or flat. Mastering communication doesn’t mean rehearsing perfect lines. It means building self-awareness to express your work with clarity and purpose. It’s what allows your true level to show up naturally in a conversation, just like Jeff said.\nLooking back, Jeff’s insight wasn’t just about interviews. It was about life. The way you communicate your work determines how far your work takes you. Learn the art of communication and storytelling. It’s the most human skill you can build — and it’ll help you thrive in the age of AI.\nhttps://newsletter.changesmith.me/p/how-to-show-your-true-level-in-a\n","date":"2026-02-18T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://prasenjitmanna.com/upskills/p/how-to-show-your-true-level-in-a-job-interview-pramoda-vyasarao/","title":"How to Show Your True Level in a Job Interview | Pramoda Vyasarao"},{"content":"Interviewing Is a Skill, Not a Test Looking back, here are eleven things I want you to remember about interviews.\nLooking back, here are eleven things I want you to remember about interviews.\nInterviewing is a skill.\nThe more you do it, the better you get. Do not wait for the perfect role to practice. Interview for low-stakes roles you can comfortably reject. Think of it as strength training for your career.\nInterviews are intelligent conversations.\nThis mental model matters a lot. When you treat interviews like a test of intelligence, pressure builds and performance drops. When you treat them as thoughtful conversations, you relax and show up more authentically. Your feelings are a compass. If you dread an interview, you likely need more preparation. If you are looking forward to the conversation, you are on the right track.\nKeep your resume updated every year.\nEven when you are not actively looking, this habit builds confidence and clarity. When someone asks about your career, you already know the story you want to tell.\nKeep your LinkedIn profile current.\nRecruiters and hiring managers search constantly. Make it easy for the right opportunities to find you.\nDo not ignore recruiters from small companies.\nAvoid defaulting to “I’m not interested right now.” Conversations with recruiters teach you about the company, the hiring process, and market trends. Even if nothing comes of it, the learning is valuable.\nUnderstand the interview loop before you start.\nEach interview has focus areas and expectations. Once you understand the rules of the game, you can play it well. Most candidates show up underprepared. Using an 80/20 approach helps you stand out quickly.\nBuild a solid list of references.\nSome companies and hiring managers care deeply about references. They use them to understand how you actually work, not just how you interview. Choose people who know your strengths and can speak honestly about your areas for growth. I will write more about this in a future article.\nAI will change recruiting, but fundamentals remain.\nTools will evolve, formats will shift, but the core question stays the same: can this candidate do this job at this company? Interviews are simply an attempt to answer that question with high confidence.\nGet help when you need it.\nA career coach can significantly improve your preparation. For big tech interviews, especially salary negotiation, a coach can pay for themselves many times over. I once helped a senior engineer negotiate a fifty-thousand-dollar sign-on bonus at Meta. She spent one thousand dollars for two sessions. That is a strong return on investment.\nInterview at multiple companies when possible.\nParallel interviews improve performance and give you leverage during negotiations. Be thoughtful when declining offers. Preserve relationships with recruiters. You never know when you might need their help again.\nImprove your storytelling skills.\nThe most critical question I faced in 2021 was simple and hard: why leave Oracle after twenty years? There had to be an authentic story behind that move. Why now. Why this role? What I could bring that was unique because of my background. Your story needs ABC: Authenticity, Brevity, and Clarity.\nIf you have not interviewed in years, feeling uncomfortable is normal. It does not mean you are behind. It simply means you are out of practice. Treat interviewing like a skill, build a plan, and give yourself permission to be bad before you get good. The confidence comes faster than you think.\nhttps://newsletter.changesmith.me/p/interviewing-is-a-skill-not-a-test\n","date":"2026-02-18T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://prasenjitmanna.com/upskills/p/interviewing-is-a-skill-not-a-test-pramoda-vyasarao/","title":"Interviewing Is a Skill, Not a Test | Pramoda Vyasarao"},{"content":"Master the Art of Asking by Pramoda Vyasarao How to ask with clarity and confidence Asking improves with intention and repetition.

You are initiating a conversation.\nKeep the request focused One clear ask per conversation reduces friction and improves outcomes.\nPay attention to timing Context matters. Choose moments when attention and capacity are available.\nConnect the ask to the contribution Frame requests around outcomes and impact.

Create value first; money follows value.\nDurable things take a long time to build. No shortcuts.\nBe the person who can figure it out. Solve problems even when you don’t initially know how.\nThere are no style points in life. Simple execution matters more than flashy moves.\nPeople want to do business with people they like. Be likable and pleasant to work with.\nThe best opportunities look like tiny cracks, not open doors. Big wins often come from small openings.\nInputs are great, but you’re paid for your outputs. Focus on results.\nExtraordinary outputs require extraordinary inputs. Be willing to put in hard work.\nThe ability to take feedback is a long-term competitive advantage. Seek and embrace critique.\nSeek out rooms where you don’t feel like you belong. Growth happens outside your comfort zone.\nAlways focus on doing. Execution beats talk every time.\nPotential is nothing without execution. Deliver on what you promise.\nEverything matters. Consistency counts in small and big things alike.\nLearn to sell. Communication and persuasion are core career skills.\nBuild a reputation for reliability. Consistent follow-through is rare and valuable.\nIf you want to accomplish anything significant, you have to work hard. Hard work sets the foundation.\nDon’t follow your passion; follow your energy. Energy fuels deep engagement and learning.\nBe selective in the games you choose to play. Win where your strengths give you advantage.\nClosed mouths don’t get fed. Ask for what you want when you’ve earned it.\nDo the “old fashioned” things well. Basic professionalism and manners still matter.\nSide hustles are usually just distractions. Many “extra” income streams steal focus from what matters most.\nYour employer (probably) doesn’t care about you. Companies prioritize business outcomes over personal loyalty — act accordingly.\nSahil’s advice focuses less on technical skills and more on mindset, execution, value creation, relationships, and real-world work habits.

Avoid avoidable mistakes like impulse buys, unnecessary debt, and emotional investing. Never allow self-worth to be dictated by net worth. Your value isn’t tied to money. Track financial progress like an athlete tracks performance. You can’t improve what you don’t measure. Increase your Margin of Freedom. Keep lifestyle below means and create slack in your finances. Focus on value, impact, and service over money. Money follows value creation. Treat income as the leverage point, not investments. Growing earning power often beats optimizing returns. Spend more for quality, not for brand. Quality often costs less in the long run. Always fade trends and external expectations. Don’t buy into cultural financial timelines. Debt is a tool, not the enemy, but use it sparingly. Avoid debt for depreciating purchases. Follow a 24-hour rule for non-essential purchases above a threshold. Delay impulse buying. Remember that investments require time, not just money. Consider both money and time inputs. Remember that returns come in many forms beyond money. Access, learning, and network can matter just as much. Never think twice about investments in yourself. Fitness, learning, and health pay huge dividends. Never use money to optimize the life out of your life. Don’t remove meaningful friction that gives life texture. Create a monthly financial check-in with your partner. Alignment prevents money-related conflict. Focus on expanding your savings rate. The gap between income and expenses is the real asset. Work towards a 12-month emergency fund. Peace of mind and optionality in hard times are worth it. Run quarterly disaster simulations. Plan for worst-case financial scenarios. Don’t waste energy on small games (unless it brings joy). Focus on major financial decisions, not trivia. Use the Bought Status Test. Ask if you’d buy something if no one knew—cuts through social signaling. Consider a barbell approach to investments. Balance safe, steady holdings with small high-risk bets. Ruthlessly eliminate complexity. Simplicity prevents mistakes and improves control. Automate payment of small recurring expenses. Free up mental energy for strategic money decisions. Conduct quarterly audits of recurring expenses. Find and cut hidden costs like unused subscriptions. Tip generously whenever you’re able. Generosity compounds happiness and goodwill. Use money as a tool for more meaningful forms of wealth. Use money to buy time, health, experiences, and purpose, not just stuff. https://www.sahilbloom.com/newsletter/26-money-rules-for-2026\n","date":"2026-01-09T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://prasenjitmanna.com/upskills/p/26-money-rules-for-2026-sahil-bloom/","title":"26 Money Rules For 2026 | Sahil Bloom"},{"content":"The Costs of Entry in Life Every single thing you want in life comes at a cost.\nThere is always a cost of entry.

That’s how powerful it can be.\nHowever, monk mode is not for everyone.\nIt’s quite intense, requires planning, and involves making sacrifices (in your social life, delaying gratification, being strict with yourself, etc.).\nBut if it speaks to you, keep reading.\nThe Rules of Monk Mode There are many different monk mode protocols out there - each with different rules and practices - but here’s how I approach monk mode:\nLimit Social Media To 20 Minutes A Day Social media is one of the biggest distractions and time-wasters.\nThe average person spends 2 hours and 31 minutes per day on social media, while young adults (age 18-29) spend an average of 4-5 hours per day on social media.\nThat’s why one of my core rules of monk mode is to limit my social media usage to 20 minutes per day.\nThis frees up a good amount of time, focus, and headspace to direct toward my main goal for that specific monk mode.\n(I use App Block to put a daily time limit on Instagram and X, which automatically blocks me from using these apps when I reach the usage limit.)\nMost social media apps and platforms have been purposefully designed to hack your attention and be as addictive as possible.\nThere’s a financial incentive to do so.\nThe more time you spend on social media, the more ad revenue these social media companies make.\nPeople often think social media is free, but it’s not.\nYou pay with your time and your attention. Your attention is their business model.\nDuring monk mode, you can’t afford to waste your time and attention on a distraction like social media, so you have to limit it (or cut it out).\nNo Porn \u0026amp; Masturbation Watching porn overstimulates the brain’s reward system, leaving you feeling lethargic, lazy, and unmotivated to do anything productive.\nIt’s cheap dopamine.\nSo, avoid porn and masturbation during your monk mode to preserve your energy and motivation for your main goal.\n90-Minutes Of Deep Work 3-4x A Day Focus is the currency of productivity.\nIf you can’t focus, you can’t produce high-quality output. And if you can’t produce high-quality output, you can’t succeed.\nThat’s why deep work forms the core of my monk modes.\nIt’s during deep work that you actually get stuff done and make progress on your main objective.\nTo maximize your deep work sessions, make sure you:\nTurn notifications off Put your phone out of sight (and out of reach) Close all unrelated internet tabs (especially social media, email \u0026amp; news) Put on noise-canceling headphones Listen to binaural beats or LoFi beats Pick one high-priority task Set a timer for 60-90 minutes Work without interruption until the timer rings I find that each hour spent in deep work equals the output of three ‘normal’ work hours, that’s how powerful it is.\nDuring monk mode, I like to do three to four deep work sessions per day, with each session being 90 minutes.\n(On the weekends I usually do 2x 90-minute deep work sessions.)\nI schedule most of my deep work sessions for the morning hours, as that’s when I’m naturally most energized, focused, and productive.\n7+ Hours of Sleep A Night During monk mode, I’m in bed by 22:30 and up by 7:30.\nIt’s a non-negotiable.\nThat’s because a good night’s sleep (7+ hours) is the foundation of a highly productive day.\nIf you don’t prioritize rest and recovery, you can’t perform at your best the next day.\n​Neuroscience has shown that we’re more prone to distractions, brain fog, and instant gratification after a bad night’s sleep.\nSo, if you want to operate at peak productivity, prioritize your sleep.\nLimit Meetings \u0026amp; Social Events During monk mode, I’m more mindful of how many meetings I schedule and how many social events I attend.\nIt’s not like I’m skipping everything, but I’m simply more selective of how (and with whom) I spend my time.\nIf you say yes to every social event or ‘let’s hop on a quick call’ request, you’ll have less time and energy for your main monk mode objective.\nNo Alcohol Although I enjoy the occasional beer or two with my friends, alcohol is a no-go during monk mode.\nThe problem with alcohol is that you borrow energy from tomorrow’s self.\nIt can be a lot of fun in the moment, but you’re going to pay the bill the day after in the form of fatigue, headaches, etc.\nSo, no alcohol during monk mode.\nPreserve your energy and mental clarity for your main goal.\nTry Out Monk Mode Yourself Monk mode is one of those things you can read about, but there’s really no point if you don’t try it out yourself.\nFeel free to follow my approach to monk mode, or consider adding some other rules or habits to your monk mode protocol, such as:\nNo TV/Netflix No news No video games Daily journaling Meditate 10-minutes a day Read 15 pages a day Eat organic foods only Exercise 30-minutes a day All in all, monk mode is an intense but highly effective method to make leaps of progress on a goal or project in just 30 days.\nIf it interests you, give it a shot.

Eating the right kinds of fat can help you have more energy and think more clearly.”\nThe best sources of high-quality fats are:\nAvocados Coconut oil Fish (wild-caught) Nuts Eggs Grass-fed butter Another key nutrient to improve our brain health and optimize cognitive performance is antioxidants.\nAntioxidants help reduce inflammation in the body and brain, which prevents cognitive decline.\nFoods rich in antioxidants are:\nBerries Spinach Brocolli Leafy greens Walnuts Turmeric Dark chocolate All in all, make sure to eat a high-quality diet rich in brain-boosting nutrients such as healthy fats and antioxidants.\nHabit #4: Exercise Often Studies show regular exercise (at least 3x a week) enhances cognitive performance and improves overall brain health.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s because physical exercise boosts blood flow to the brain and increases the production of Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF).\nBDNF is an essential protein that promotes the health \u0026amp; growth of neurons in the brain, which is crucial for overall brain health.\nSo, if you want to boost your mental performance, make sure to exercise more often. Your brain will thank you for it.\nTo your productivity,\nReferences ","date":"2024-08-25T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://prasenjitmanna.com/upskills/p/4-science-based-habits-to-build-a-highly-productive-brain-jari-roomer/","title":"4 Science-based habits to build a highly productive brain| Jari Roomer"},{"content":"The Career Guide Principles by Sahil Bloom Build a Personal Board of Advisors Swallow the Frog for Your Boss Create a Decentralized Growth Tribe Learn to Sell Prioritize Experience, Not Salary Avoid the Comparison Trap Find Your Zone of Genius Own Your Mistakes Get In \u0026ldquo;The Room\u0026rdquo; Build \u0026ldquo;T-Shaped\u0026rdquo; Knowledge References The Career Success Guide Forget Mentors: Employ a Personal Board of Directors Assembling Your Personal Board of Advisors ","date":"2024-03-03T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://prasenjitmanna.com/upskills/p/the-career-guide-principle-sahil-bloom/","title":"The Career Guide Principle | Sahil Bloom"},{"content":"How to nail any phone interview by Ramit Sethi References How to nail any phone interview\n","date":"2024-02-12T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://prasenjitmanna.com/upskills/p/how-to-nail-any-phone-interview-ramit-sethi/","title":"How to nail any phone interview | Ramit Sethi"},{"content":"How To Write An Email Requesting Something (\u0026amp; actually get it) by Ramit Sethi References How To Write An Email Requesting Something (\u0026amp; actually get it)\n","date":"2024-02-12T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://prasenjitmanna.com/upskills/p/how-to-write-an-email-requesting-something-ramit-sethi/","title":"How To Write An Email Requesting Something | Ramit Sethi"},{"content":"How to nail any phone interview by Ramit Sethi References The “Tell me About Yourself” Interview Question\n","date":"2024-02-12T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://prasenjitmanna.com/upskills/p/the-tell-me-about-yourself-interview-question-ramit-sethi/","title":"The “Tell me About Yourself” Interview Question | Ramit Sethi"},{"content":"24 Ways to Change Your Life in 2024 by Sahil Bloom Life Actions To identify what to prioritize in your days, use my Energy Calendar Technique.

Build Your Life Around Themes, Not Goals Goals focus on outcomes, themes on the process Goals = Not satisfied with where you are. You achieve it once and then not satisfied anymore. Themes = “I want to provide value that will reward me financially.” Scott Adams, the author of Dilbert, has some great thoughts on goals vs. systems. So does James Clear. And Rohan Rajiv. 2.) Build Your List, But Also Connect Your List When you introduce two people who hit it off, you’re the meta connector, the common factor. They will always remember you and you’ll always be on their mind for future potential connections they can make that would be useful for you. Introduce two people with an idea in mind. If you can help two other people make money then eventually, good things will happen to you. Learn more about how to deal with your fear of failure.\nCharles Duhigg 3.) The Power of Habit Human willpower is limited; it gets depleted over time Like a muscle, you can strengthen it by using it more You should try to change behaviors into habits (e.g brushing your teeth is easy because it’s a habit) Developing good keystone habits (exercising, financial discipline, etc.) creates chain reactions — permeating other areas of your life and changing and rearranging your other habits as you integrate the (keystone) habit into your life. 4.) The Three Parts of a Habit Cues (starts behavior) Routine (behavior itself) Rewards (how brain learns to encode for the future) Learn more about the power of habits.\nRob Kelly 5.) Create a Qualities of Achievement Document This is a simple way to increase your confidence This should be a blueprint to achieve future success Learn more about how to create your own here. 6.) Turn Ideas into Reality Leverage your competencies. What are you really good at? What do you love doing? Deposit your content about the topic into the universe. Set up a feedback loop, measure what is going on. This echoes Austin Kleon’s 3 reasons you should show your work.\nLearn more about how to find your purpose in life.\nChris Yeh 7.) Networking is Not Transactional If someone is smart/interesting, take the time to meet with them. It is about relationships. Meet with smart people and stay in touch. Calling people keeps you top of mind. Talk to people –\u0026gt; Find out where there’s a need –\u0026gt; Prove you can fill that need 8.) The Architecture of Top Performers What’s your foundation? It needs to be sturdy so you can build on top of it.\nWhat are your non-negotiables that have to take precedence? Things like your family. What other non-negotiables need to be in place to ensure you’re doing your best work? (Exercise, Sleep, etc.)\nLearn more about how to think like top performers and leaders.\nBJ Fogg 9.) Create Tiny Habits and Eliminate Barriers to Inefficiency Design for laziness (e.g if there’s a full water bottle on your desk at all times you’ll drink more water) Incremental improvements are more reliable and robust for long-term behavior change 10.) Do Hard Things Now to Make Future Things Easy Motivation only has one role in our lives and that’s to help us to do hard things. Build a system to make it easy even with low motivation. A great example would be to prepare all your meals for the week in individual Tupperware on Sunday when you have energy so that during your (busy) work week, when your motivation to eat healthy is low, you can just grab your food and heat it up. Learn more about how to get out of a rut and find the motivation to change.\nBen Casnocha 11.) Career Plans Limit Your Options in Today’s World Sheryl Sandberg says, “I don’t have a career plan” 3 things to keep in mind when thinking about your career: 12.)When Making Important Decisions, Use the Regret Minimization Framework Clearly I made up a new word, “minimalization” in my commonplace book notes.\nHere’s 5 Ways to Evaluate Tough Career Decisions.\nAnd here’s the Heath brothers four-step process designed to counteract the array of biases and irrationality that disrupt our decisions.\nLearn more about how career builders choose the right path.\nGretchen Rubin 13.) You’re Probably Happier Than You Think The first step to greater happiness is to acknowledge how happy you are now, then deliberately think about what makes you happy to add more of it.\nThe best way I’ve (personally) found to do this is to start a gratitude journal.\nHere’s four rituals to keep you happy all the time.\n14.) Negative Emotions Play an Important Role in Happiness If you have strong self-knowledge, negative emotions provide signals of things you need to change in your life.\nWhom do you envy? Why? (e.g. I envy writers because they have more flexibility to work from home; therefore, I’m going to try and shift my work priorities to work from home more often to increase my happiness) Make things you envy a priority to obtain What steps can you take to make that happen for you? What do you lie about? If you’re uncomfortable telling the truth, perhaps there are steps you need to take to change (e.g. you tell everyone you moved closer to work so you could walk, but you still drive in everyday) Learn more about how to be happy for life.\nMichael Ellsberg 15.) Your Level of Success is Dependent on How Open you are to Feedback It’s not about you (personally); it’s about your performance Actively solicit how you come across to others When asking for feedback, tell others/your boss, “I want your hardest shot and I won’t be offended” 16.) A Network of Relationships is Essentially a Network of Trust Act in a way that a large number of people will trust you Proactively suggest some ways to help those in your network; be very specific Sometimes busy people are busy (take a long-term approach) Trust is currency. It reduces time and cost of doing transactions Your brain needs diversity Learn more about how to network and invest in yourself.\nRon Lieber 17.) It’s Imperative to Understand the Strategies and Tactics Required to Elevate Your Career Take the time to study the people who came before you Focus on people’s biggest pain points and/or their largest expense Come up with original answers for old questions Make complicated things “make sense” Be conversational: Start at the beginning/from scratch Help relatively smart people understand something Look for emerging areas of interest (cast a wide/eclectic net) Stunt + aspirational + useful + service to people = success (e.g Julia Child’s recipes blogged by Julie Powell) Start with your obsessions, then move at half steps to find your beat or niche 18.) A Great Way to Build Instant Rapport is to Write Smart, Thoughtful Dashes Send notes letting people know what you like and/or admire about their work; be very specific and detailed Example: “Hey I read your thing and I liked/noticed/appreciated…” Learn more about how to build instant rapport and make it to the top of your field.\nChris Guillebeau 19.) 4 Ways to Manage Criticism Recognize the struggle around focusing on the one negative comment amidst many compliments. Recognize that criticism is often a project of the giver. It might have nothing to do you with you. Take the time to step away, then separate the point from the emotion. There might be truth to the criticism. Adopt a long-term focus. Critics are interested in battles; whereas, you want to win the war. 20.) 3 Keys to Achieving Your Goals Start with internal motivation Then add public accountability Be consistent and persistent Learn more about how to set goals, crush them, and live a better life.\nJosh Kaufman 21.) How to Acquire a Skill Rapidly 20 hours is the critical threshold of practice Deconstruction: Break down the skill. What equipment? What micro skills? (Consider Tim Ferriss’ DiSSS method) Learn just enough theory to (self) skill correct. Less research, more practice Remove practice barriers Practice, not research, for 20 hours 22.) How and Why You Should Systematize Your Life If you spend more than 5 hours/week on something, you should create a system Do it once. Do your best. Document it. Systematize it. A system is a repeatable process with repeatable results. Awareness and flexibility to tweak processes and get results. Makes it easier to diagnose problems Example: Hiring a housekeeper. Washing dishes = X amount of time (repeatable), but what if we used that time to write a blog post? (lasts forever) Learn more about acquiring any skill rapidly.\nPamela Slim 23.) How to Be Invaluable at Your Job Be hyper-aware of market dynamics, not just trends Think of your boss as a client Be in charge of how you maintain employability and generate revenue Ensure you’re in a position aligned with your natural strengths Study your craft inside and outside of your company Clearly define the people you want to emulate Get very specific, clear feedback (and learn how to take it) 24.) Don’t Undervalue Yourself: You MUST charge what the market will bear If you think it’s “too much,” invest it back into yourself Use it to increase your influence Use it to buy your time back Or just give it to charity Learn more about becoming invaluable at your job.\n","date":"2024-01-09T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://prasenjitmanna.com/upskills/p/ramits-brain-trust-insights-ramit-sethi/","title":"Ramit's Brain Trust Insights | Ramit Sethi"},{"content":"\u0026ldquo;Scaling yourself during hypergrowth by Julia Grace The higher up you go your job is sales People are not resources, they are people Resist the urge to solve non-engineering problem with engineering your job is to ask questions (good questions), not have answers recuit for the long long games, its a long term relations which only works. write down the requirments and expectations for every position you are hiring for Technical skills are always important (to ask good questions and grasp challenges quickly), but ability to write well becomes essential. you learn more from failure than success leaders build orginizations that mirror their strengths and weeknesses.

Do that again in the late afternoon, prior to sunset. Wake up at the same time each day and go to sleep when you first start to feel sleepy. Avoid caffeine within 8-10 hours of bedtime. If you have sleep disturbances, insomnia, or anxiety about sleep, try the research-supported protocols on the Reveri app Avoid viewing bright lights—especially bright overhead lights between 10 pm and 4 am. Limit daytime naps to less than 90 min, or don’t nap at all.

Take short breaks after 20-30 minutes. Don\u0026rsquo;t study in the living room, bedroom, etc. Study in a separate place dedicated to studying. Don\u0026rsquo;t try to memorize without understanding. Try to understand the concept first. Don\u0026rsquo;t always study alone. Studying in groups helps a lot. Don\u0026rsquo;t highlight text blindly. Highlighting doesn\u0026rsquo;t help that much. It only indicates Recognization not Recollection of the topic. Always take notes. Reviewing the notes after a short time helps a lot. Always try to teach others what you have learned. Teaching is the best way of learning. Sleep is so much important for pushing something into your long-term memory. Get at least 7-8 hours of sound sleep. Use the SQ3R(survey, question, recite, read, review) method while studying. Use Mnemonics. It\u0026rsquo;s the best way to memorize facts.

[{"content":"Monk Mode: An extreme (but effective) 30-day protocol to become your most productive self Monk mode is a period of full focus and commitment to one goal or project - usually between 14 to 30 days.\nDuring this time, you block out distractions, limit obligations, and put yourself in peak performance mode, so you can make leaps of progress on a goal or project.\nI like to practice monk mode three to four times a year, with each monk mode being 30 days.\nDuring 30 days of monk mode, I can get done what I’d normally do in 90 ‘ordinary’ days. That’s how powerful it can be.\nHowever, monk mode is not for everyone.\nIt’s quite intense, requires planning, and involves making sacrifices (in your social life, delaying gratification, being strict with yourself, etc.).\nBut if it speaks to you, keep reading.\nThe Rules of Monk Mode There are many different monk mode protocols out there - each with different rules and practices - but here’s how I approach monk mode:\nLimit Social Media To 20 Minutes A Day Social media is one of the biggest distractions and time-wasters.\nThe average person spends 2 hours and 31 minutes per day on social media, while young adults (age 18-29) spend an average of 4-5 hours per day on social media.\nThat’s why one of my core rules of monk mode is to limit my social media usage to 20 minutes per day.\nThis frees up a good amount of time, focus, and headspace to direct toward my main goal for that specific monk mode.\n(I use App Block to put a daily time limit on Instagram and X, which automatically blocks me from using these apps when I reach the usage limit.)\nMost social media apps and platforms have been purposefully designed to hack your attention and be as addictive as possible.\nThere’s a financial incentive to do so.\nThe more time you spend on social media, the more ad revenue these social media companies make.\nPeople often think social media is free, but it’s not.\nYou pay with your time and your attention. Your attention is their business model.\nDuring monk mode, you can’t afford to waste your time and attention on a distraction like social media, so you have to limit it (or cut it out).\nNo Porn \u0026amp; Masturbation Watching porn overstimulates the brain’s reward system, leaving you feeling lethargic, lazy, and unmotivated to do anything productive.\nIt’s cheap dopamine.\nSo, avoid porn and masturbation during your monk mode to preserve your energy and motivation for your main goal.\n90-Minutes Of Deep Work 3-4x A Day Focus is the currency of productivity.\nIf you can’t focus, you can’t produce high-quality output. And if you can’t produce high-quality output, you can’t succeed.\nThat’s why deep work forms the core of my monk modes.\nIt’s during deep work that you actually get stuff done and make progress on your main objective.\nTo maximize your deep work sessions, make sure you:\nTurn notifications off Put your phone out of sight (and out of reach) Close all unrelated internet tabs (especially social media, email \u0026amp; news) Put on noise-canceling headphones Listen to binaural beats or LoFi beats Pick one high-priority task Set a timer for 60-90 minutes Work without interruption until the timer rings I find that each hour spent in deep work equals the output of three ‘normal’ work hours, that’s how powerful it is.\nDuring monk mode, I like to do three to four deep work sessions per day, with each session being 90 minutes.\n(On the weekends I usually do 2x 90-minute deep work sessions.)\nI schedule most of my deep work sessions for the morning hours, as that’s when I’m naturally most energized, focused, and productive.\n7+ Hours of Sleep A Night During monk mode, I’m in bed by 22:30 and up by 7:30.\nIt’s a non-negotiable.\nThat’s because a good night’s sleep (7+ hours) is the foundation of a highly productive day.\nIf you don’t prioritize rest and recovery, you can’t perform at your best the next day.\n​Neuroscience has shown that we’re more prone to distractions, brain fog, and instant gratification after a bad night’s sleep.\nSo, if you want to operate at peak productivity, prioritize your sleep.\nLimit Meetings \u0026amp; Social Events During monk mode, I’m more mindful of how many meetings I schedule and how many social events I attend.\nIt’s not like I’m skipping everything, but I’m simply more selective of how (and with whom) I spend my time.\nIf you say yes to every social event or ‘let’s hop on a quick call’ request, you’ll have less time and energy for your main monk mode objective.\nNo Alcohol Although I enjoy the occasional beer or two with my friends, alcohol is a no-go during monk mode.\nThe problem with alcohol is that you borrow energy from tomorrow’s self.\nIt can be a lot of fun in the moment, but you’re going to pay the bill the day after in the form of fatigue, headaches, etc.\nSo, no alcohol during monk mode.\nPreserve your energy and mental clarity for your main goal.\nTry Out Monk Mode Yourself Monk mode is one of those things you can read about, but there’s really no point if you don’t try it out yourself.\nFeel free to follow my approach to monk mode, or consider adding some other rules or habits to your monk mode protocol, such as:\nNo TV/Netflix No news No video games Daily journaling Meditate 10-minutes a day Read 15 pages a day Eat organic foods only Exercise 30-minutes a day All in all, monk mode is an intense but highly effective method to make leaps of progress on a goal or project in just 30 days.\nIf it interests you, give it a shot. I can highly recommend it.\nTo your productivity,\nReferences ","date":"2024-09-13T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://prasenjitmanna.com/upskills/p/monk-mode-an-extreme-but-effective-30-day-protocol-to-become-your-most-productive-self-jari-roomer/","title":" Monk Mode: An extreme (but effective) 30-day protocol to become your most productive self | Jari Roomer"},{"content":"4 Science-based habits to build a highly productive brain| Jari Roomer Most people reading this are - or will be - knowledge workers.\nIn other words, they make money with their mind.\nAnd if you make money with your mind, you\u0026rsquo;re a mental athlete.\nJust like Olympic athletes train their muscles, mental athletes should train their brains, as it can help with:\nFaster information processing Enhanced focus \u0026amp; mental clarity Increased mental efficiency Better decision-making Less brain fog \u0026amp; mental fatigue In other words, a healthy, high-performing brain gives you a competitive advantage in today\u0026rsquo;s fast-paced knowledge economy.\nAnd that\u0026rsquo;s why, in this email, we\u0026rsquo;ll go over four science-based habits to build a faster, more productive brain.\nHabit #1: Manage Stress Chronic stress wreaks havoc on the brain and is linked to decreased gray matter in the prefrontal cortex - the area of the brain responsible for future planning, attention, and self-control.\nFurthermore, prolonged exposure to stress can lead to chronic inflammation, which has been associated with cognitive decline.\nSo, to ensure a healthy and high-performing brain - and overall healthy life - it’s important to practice stress-reducing habits such as:\nMeditation Exercise Journaling Gratitude Breathwork Take time off Spend time in nature Habit #2: Prioritize Your Sleep Sleep is “recovery mode” for the brain and is vital for better learning, memory, and cognitive function.\nDuring sleep, our brains actively work on repairing neural connections and flushing out toxins from our system.\nThis critical process helps to protect our brains from potential harm and ensures that we can function at our best when we\u0026rsquo;re awake.\nTo improve the quality of your sleep, follow these tips:\nKeep your bedroom cool, dark, and quiet to create an optimal sleeping environment Put your devices away 1-2 hours before going to bed, as the blue light emitted from our screens disrupt the circadian rhythm and block melatonin production (an essential sleep hormone) Don’t consume caffeine after 3 pm and avoid excessive sugar consumption in the evening All in all, getting good sleep (7-8 hours per night) is one of the best things you can do for better brain health and cognitive performance.\nHabit #3: Eat Brain-Boosting Foods Foods rich in high-quality fats are one of the best brain boosters.\nAs biohacker and brain expert Dave Asprey writes:\n“Fat is an essential nutrient for your brain. Eating the right kinds of fat can help you have more energy and think more clearly.”\nThe best sources of high-quality fats are:\nAvocados Coconut oil Fish (wild-caught) Nuts Eggs Grass-fed butter Another key nutrient to improve our brain health and optimize cognitive performance is antioxidants.\nAntioxidants help reduce inflammation in the body and brain, which prevents cognitive decline.\nFoods rich in antioxidants are:\nBerries Spinach Brocolli Leafy greens Walnuts Turmeric Dark chocolate All in all, make sure to eat a high-quality diet rich in brain-boosting nutrients such as healthy fats and antioxidants.\nHabit #4: Exercise Often Studies show regular exercise (at least 3x a week) enhances cognitive performance and improves overall brain health.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s because physical exercise boosts blood flow to the brain and increases the production of Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF).\nBDNF is an essential protein that promotes the health \u0026amp; growth of neurons in the brain, which is crucial for overall brain health.\nSo, if you want to boost your mental performance, make sure to exercise more often. Your brain will thank you for it.\nTo your productivity,\nReferences ","date":"2024-08-25T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://prasenjitmanna.com/upskills/p/4-science-based-habits-to-build-a-highly-productive-brain-jari-roomer/","title":"4 Science-based habits to build a highly productive brain| Jari Roomer"},{"content":"The Career Guide Principles by Sahil Bloom Build a Personal Board of Advisors Swallow the Frog for Your Boss Create a Decentralized Growth Tribe Learn to Sell Prioritize Experience, Not Salary Avoid the Comparison Trap Find Your Zone of Genius Own Your Mistakes Get In \u0026ldquo;The Room\u0026rdquo; Build \u0026ldquo;T-Shaped\u0026rdquo; Knowledge References The Career Success Guide Forget Mentors: Employ a Personal Board of Directors Assembling Your Personal Board of Advisors ","date":"2024-03-03T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://prasenjitmanna.com/upskills/p/the-career-guide-principle-sahil-bloom/","title":"The Career Guide Principle | Sahil Bloom"},{"content":"How to nail any phone interview by Ramit Sethi References How to nail any phone interview\n","date":"2024-02-12T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://prasenjitmanna.com/upskills/p/how-to-nail-any-phone-interview-ramit-sethi/","title":"How to nail any phone interview | Ramit Sethi"},{"content":"How To Write An Email Requesting Something (\u0026amp; actually get it) by Ramit Sethi References How To Write An Email Requesting Something (\u0026amp; actually get it)\n","date":"2024-02-12T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://prasenjitmanna.com/upskills/p/how-to-write-an-email-requesting-something-ramit-sethi/","title":"How To Write An Email Requesting Something | Ramit Sethi"},{"content":"How to nail any phone interview by Ramit Sethi References The “Tell me About Yourself” Interview Question\n","date":"2024-02-12T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://prasenjitmanna.com/upskills/p/the-tell-me-about-yourself-interview-question-ramit-sethi/","title":"The “Tell me About Yourself” Interview Question | Ramit Sethi"},{"content":"24 Ways to Change Your Life in 2024 by Sahil Bloom Life Actions To identify what to prioritize in your days, use my Energy Calendar Technique.

Build Your Life Around Themes, Not Goals Goals focus on outcomes, themes on the process Goals = Not satisfied with where you are. You achieve it once and then not satisfied anymore. Themes = “I want to provide value that will reward me financially.” Scott Adams, the author of Dilbert, has some great thoughts on goals vs. systems. So does James Clear. And Rohan Rajiv. 2.) Build Your List, But Also Connect Your List When you introduce two people who hit it off, you’re the meta connector, the common factor. They will always remember you and you’ll always be on their mind for future potential connections they can make that would be useful for you. Introduce two people with an idea in mind. If you can help two other people make money then eventually, good things will happen to you. Learn more about how to deal with your fear of failure.\nCharles Duhigg 3.) The Power of Habit Human willpower is limited; it gets depleted over time Like a muscle, you can strengthen it by using it more You should try to change behaviors into habits (e.g brushing your teeth is easy because it’s a habit) Developing good keystone habits (exercising, financial discipline, etc.) creates chain reactions — permeating other areas of your life and changing and rearranging your other habits as you integrate the (keystone) habit into your life. 4.) The Three Parts of a Habit Cues (starts behavior) Routine (behavior itself) Rewards (how brain learns to encode for the future) Learn more about the power of habits.\nRob Kelly 5.) Create a Qualities of Achievement Document This is a simple way to increase your confidence This should be a blueprint to achieve future success Learn more about how to create your own here. 6.) Turn Ideas into Reality Leverage your competencies. What are you really good at? What do you love doing? Deposit your content about the topic into the universe. Set up a feedback loop, measure what is going on. This echoes Austin Kleon’s 3 reasons you should show your work.\nLearn more about how to find your purpose in life.\nChris Yeh 7.) Networking is Not Transactional If someone is smart/interesting, take the time to meet with them. It is about relationships. Meet with smart people and stay in touch. Calling people keeps you top of mind. Talk to people –\u0026gt; Find out where there’s a need –\u0026gt; Prove you can fill that need 8.) The Architecture of Top Performers What’s your foundation? It needs to be sturdy so you can build on top of it.\nWhat are your non-negotiables that have to take precedence? Things like your family. What other non-negotiables need to be in place to ensure you’re doing your best work? (Exercise, Sleep, etc.)\nLearn more about how to think like top performers and leaders.\nBJ Fogg 9.) Create Tiny Habits and Eliminate Barriers to Inefficiency Design for laziness (e.g if there’s a full water bottle on your desk at all times you’ll drink more water) Incremental improvements are more reliable and robust for long-term behavior change 10.) Do Hard Things Now to Make Future Things Easy Motivation only has one role in our lives and that’s to help us to do hard things. Build a system to make it easy even with low motivation. A great example would be to prepare all your meals for the week in individual Tupperware on Sunday when you have energy so that during your (busy) work week, when your motivation to eat healthy is low, you can just grab your food and heat it up. Learn more about how to get out of a rut and find the motivation to change.\nBen Casnocha 11.) Career Plans Limit Your Options in Today’s World Sheryl Sandberg says, “I don’t have a career plan” 3 things to keep in mind when thinking about your career: 12.)When Making Important Decisions, Use the Regret Minimization Framework Clearly I made up a new word, “minimalization” in my commonplace book notes.\nHere’s 5 Ways to Evaluate Tough Career Decisions.\nAnd here’s the Heath brothers four-step process designed to counteract the array of biases and irrationality that disrupt our decisions.\nLearn more about how career builders choose the right path.\nGretchen Rubin 13.) You’re Probably Happier Than You Think The first step to greater happiness is to acknowledge how happy you are now, then deliberately think about what makes you happy to add more of it.\nThe best way I’ve (personally) found to do this is to start a gratitude journal.\nHere’s four rituals to keep you happy all the time.\n14.) Negative Emotions Play an Important Role in Happiness If you have strong self-knowledge, negative emotions provide signals of things you need to change in your life.\nWhom do you envy? Why? (e.g. I envy writers because they have more flexibility to work from home; therefore, I’m going to try and shift my work priorities to work from home more often to increase my happiness) Make things you envy a priority to obtain What steps can you take to make that happen for you? What do you lie about? If you’re uncomfortable telling the truth, perhaps there are steps you need to take to change (e.g. you tell everyone you moved closer to work so you could walk, but you still drive in everyday) Learn more about how to be happy for life.\nMichael Ellsberg 15.) Your Level of Success is Dependent on How Open you are to Feedback It’s not about you (personally); it’s about your performance Actively solicit how you come across to others When asking for feedback, tell others/your boss, “I want your hardest shot and I won’t be offended” 16.) A Network of Relationships is Essentially a Network of Trust Act in a way that a large number of people will trust you Proactively suggest some ways to help those in your network; be very specific Sometimes busy people are busy (take a long-term approach) Trust is currency. It reduces time and cost of doing transactions Your brain needs diversity Learn more about how to network and invest in yourself.\nRon Lieber 17.) It’s Imperative to Understand the Strategies and Tactics Required to Elevate Your Career Take the time to study the people who came before you Focus on people’s biggest pain points and/or their largest expense Come up with original answers for old questions Make complicated things “make sense” Be conversational: Start at the beginning/from scratch Help relatively smart people understand something Look for emerging areas of interest (cast a wide/eclectic net) Stunt + aspirational + useful + service to people = success (e.g Julia Child’s recipes blogged by Julie Powell) Start with your obsessions, then move at half steps to find your beat or niche 18.) A Great Way to Build Instant Rapport is to Write Smart, Thoughtful Dashes Send notes letting people know what you like and/or admire about their work; be very specific and detailed Example: “Hey I read your thing and I liked/noticed/appreciated…” Learn more about how to build instant rapport and make it to the top of your field.\nChris Guillebeau 19.) 4 Ways to Manage Criticism Recognize the struggle around focusing on the one negative comment amidst many compliments. Recognize that criticism is often a project of the giver. It might have nothing to do you with you. Take the time to step away, then separate the point from the emotion. There might be truth to the criticism. Adopt a long-term focus. Critics are interested in battles; whereas, you want to win the war. 20.) 3 Keys to Achieving Your Goals Start with internal motivation Then add public accountability Be consistent and persistent Learn more about how to set goals, crush them, and live a better life.\nJosh Kaufman 21.) How to Acquire a Skill Rapidly 20 hours is the critical threshold of practice Deconstruction: Break down the skill. What equipment? What micro skills? (Consider Tim Ferriss’ DiSSS method) Learn just enough theory to (self) skill correct. Less research, more practice Remove practice barriers Practice, not research, for 20 hours 22.) How and Why You Should Systematize Your Life If you spend more than 5 hours/week on something, you should create a system Do it once. Do your best. Document it. Systematize it. A system is a repeatable process with repeatable results. Awareness and flexibility to tweak processes and get results. Makes it easier to diagnose problems Example: Hiring a housekeeper. Washing dishes = X amount of time (repeatable), but what if we used that time to write a blog post? (lasts forever) Learn more about acquiring any skill rapidly.\nPamela Slim 23.) How to Be Invaluable at Your Job Be hyper-aware of market dynamics, not just trends Think of your boss as a client Be in charge of how you maintain employability and generate revenue Ensure you’re in a position aligned with your natural strengths Study your craft inside and outside of your company Clearly define the people you want to emulate Get very specific, clear feedback (and learn how to take it) 24.) Don’t Undervalue Yourself: You MUST charge what the market will bear If you think it’s “too much,” invest it back into yourself Use it to increase your influence Use it to buy your time back Or just give it to charity Learn more about becoming invaluable at your job.\n","date":"2024-01-09T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://prasenjitmanna.com/upskills/p/ramits-brain-trust-insights-ramit-sethi/","title":"Ramit's Brain Trust Insights | Ramit Sethi"},{"content":"\u0026ldquo;Scaling yourself during hypergrowth by Julia Grace The higher up you go your job is sales People are not resources, they are people Resist the urge to solve non-engineering problem with engineering your job is to ask questions (good questions), not have answers recuit for the long long games, its a long term relations which only works. write down the requirments and expectations for every position you are hiring for Technical skills are always important (to ask good questions and grasp challenges quickly), but ability to write well becomes essential. you learn more from failure than success leaders build orginizations that mirror their strengths and weeknesses.

If you have sleep disturbances, insomnia, or anxiety about sleep, try the research-supported protocols on the Reveri app Avoid viewing bright lights—especially bright overhead lights between 10 pm and 4 am. Limit daytime naps to less than 90 min, or don’t nap at all.

Reviewing the notes after a short time helps a lot. Always try to teach others what you have learned. Teaching is the best way of learning. Sleep is so much important for pushing something into your long-term memory. Get at least 7-8 hours of sound sleep. Use the SQ3R(survey, question, recite, read, review) method while studying. Use Mnemonics. It\u0026rsquo;s the best way to memorize facts.
